      <p>From the moment I met you, I knew there was something special about you. You have a light within you that shines so brightly and you bring so much joy to everyone around you.</p>
      <p>I love the way you make me laugh, the way you support me through everything, and the way you always know how to make everything better. You are my rock, my confidant, and my best friend.</p>
      <p>I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you, Nicole. You are the one for me and I promise to always love you and cherish you.</p>
